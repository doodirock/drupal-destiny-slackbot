# drupal-destiny-slackbot
You have to like three things to use this bot.  

1) You're into Drupal and have a site set up using it

2) Your team uses slack and is also into video games

3) The main game you love is Destiny and you like to see your stats 

### Install
If all the above rings true then you came to the write place.  To install, go into the destiny_api modlue and enter in your token for destiny's api and your key for slack.  Then simple drop the package into your modules folder and enable.  You will likely need to configure the slash commands on your Slack account to get this to all work.
